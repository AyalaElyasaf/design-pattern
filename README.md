## About the Project

This project is designed to showcase the implementation of several well-known design patterns in a practical application. The application simulates a GIT version control system, providing a real-world context to understand how these patterns can be applied effectively.

## Design Patterns Used

- **State**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **Command**
- **Singleton**
 **More**
  
## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Programming language used to develop the project.
- **.NET Framework**: Framework for building and running applications.
- **Visual Studio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for C# development.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-system-simulation.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd git-system-simulation
    ```

3. **Open the project in Visual Studio**:
    - Open Visual Studio.
    - Click on "Open a project or solution".
    - Navigate to the project directory and select the solution file (.sln).

4. **Build the project**:
    - In Visual Studio, go to `Build > Build Solution`.

5. **Run the project**:
    - Press `F5` or click on the `Start` button to run the application.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Repository**: Create a new GIT repository in the application.
2. **Add Files**: Add files to the repository.
3. **Commit Changes**: Commit changes to the repository.
4. **Undo Changes**: Use the memento pattern to undo changes.
5. **State Management**: Observe state transitions in the repository.
6. **Notifications**: Get notified of changes using the observer pattern.
